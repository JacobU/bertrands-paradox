# Bertrands Paradox

Bertrand's Paradox is "is a problem within the classical interpretation of probability theory. Joseph Bertrand introduced it in his work Calcul des probabilit√©s (1889), as an example to show that the principle of indifference may not produce definite, well-defined results for probabilities if it is applied uncritically when the domain of possibilities is infinite."
